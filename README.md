## COVID-19 Data Analysis
- Team Disinfectant Wipes

This is a data analysis project of COVID-19 for UCD MSBA Hackathon.

Our project aims to quantify the effect of the awareness of wearing a mask in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Leverageing google trend data, stay-at-home orders, and medical resources data, we built fixed effect panel data regression and found that the increase in the awareness of wearing a mask (quantified by search interest on Google) was most associated with lowering the increase in confirmed cases of COVID-19. That is to say, when people start to search for masks, that' s when they truly became aware of how serious the pandemic situation is, and started to take precautions. Hence, we recommended that state governments should advise (if not require) all citizens to wear masks in public as early as they could.
